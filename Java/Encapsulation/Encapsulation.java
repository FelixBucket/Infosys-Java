/* 

We can put a lock on the customer data so that it is not changed by any other class by:

declaring the variables of a class as private
Private variables are those which are accessible only inside the class
using public setter and getter methods within the class to set and get the values of the fields
The methods that are used to set values to private variables are called setter methods.The methods that are used to fetch the values of private variables are called getter methods.
Getter methods are also known as accessor methods and setter methods are also known as mutator methods.
This way of restricting access to data is called encapsulation.

Encapsulation is one of the basic principles of OOP.

Here, the variables of a particular class are hidden from other classes. We can access these variables only through the methods of the class. Hence, it is also referred as data hiding.
