/* 

Some of the important points that you should be knowing about arrays are:

An array is a collection of similar data in contiguous memory locations referred by the same name

Can be used to store data of primitive as well as reference types

Holds a fixed number of values, determined at the time of array declaration

Array index always starts from zero

The length attribute of an array can be used to get its size

Once initialized, the size of an array cannot be changed
