One more type of Inheritance is Hierarchical Inheritance. 

When more than one class extends the same base class, then that type of inheritance is said to be Hierarchical Inheritance.

Here, the Customer class is the parent class and the RegularCustomer and Guest classes extend the Customer class. This is an example of Hierarchical Inheritance.
