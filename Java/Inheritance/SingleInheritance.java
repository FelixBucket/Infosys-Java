/* 

There are multiple types of inheritance. We will be discussing some of them in this course.

The first type of inheritance that we will be discussing is Single Inheritance.

In single inheritance, one class is extended by only one class. 

You can see in the image given below that only one class, i.e., RegularCustomer extends Customer class.

*/

public class Customer {
	// Parent/Super/Base class
}
public class RegularCustomer extends Customer {        // RegularCustomer is a Customer
	// Child/Sub/Derived class
}
