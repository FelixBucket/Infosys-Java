// Let us consider the scenario of ordering food. Let us assume that the food items ordered are stored in an array.

String[] orders = new String[size];

/* 

What are the limitations of using an array?

Assume that the size of the array is 4 and you have already placed 4 orders. Now, you want to add the fifth order, i.e., your favorite pizza. 

Will you be able to add?

Since arrays have fixed size, ordering food items after a limit is not possible.
