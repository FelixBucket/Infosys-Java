/* 

By now, you know about inheritance and polymorphism.

One more thing that you should be knowing is that in Java, there is an Object class which is the implicit super class of all classes.

It provides useful methods which can be overridden according to our requirement.

Some of the commonly used methods of the Object class are:

equals()

hashCode()

toString()

To understand the importance of the methods of Object class, let us consider the scenario of SwiftFood. While adding food items, it is better to check if the same food item is not being added twice.

Two food items are considered to be the same if their name and type are same.

Let us compare two Food objects using the == operator in the next Tryout.
