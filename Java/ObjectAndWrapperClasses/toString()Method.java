/* 

Apart from equals() and hashCode(), the Object class provides another method named toString().

The toString() method returns a textual representation of an object.

By default, it returns a string consisting of the name of the object's class, the '@' character, and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. E.g. - Food@af7d0676

It should be overridden to provide a meaningful textual representation.

The returned text should be concise, easy to read and informative.
