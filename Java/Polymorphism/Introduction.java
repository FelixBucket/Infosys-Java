Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take different forms, i.e., a single action that can be performed in different ways. So, polymorphism means many forms.

Consider a simple example of a Bank. All the banks are providing loans to its customers.

But are they all providing it at the same rate?

No, rate of interest may differ from bank to bank. So, object of the Bank class may behave differently when we try to get the interest rate for bank loans (through a method).

The Bank class, here, shows polymorphism.


Consider the SwiftFood scenario in which a Customer is ordering food online.

Based on the different types of customers, the final price and thus the payment of bill gets changed. This is because, the Guests are charged a delivery charge of $2.0 and other registered customers get some discounts. Among them, Regular Customer gets a discount of 5% and Premium Customers 8%. Premium Customers also have a provision to pay the bill using their membership card points.

So, the final payment of the bill differs for each of the customers. Thus, Customer class also exhibits polymorphism.
