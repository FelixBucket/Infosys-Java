Implicit Type Conversion is know as Widening. It happens when:

  When a value of data type with smaller range is assinged to a variable of a compatible data type with larger range

  When two variables of different data types are involved in an expression, the value of smaller range datatype is converted to a value of larger range dattype and then the operation is performed
