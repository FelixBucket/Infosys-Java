/* 

Apart from the Collection interface, Java also has an interface that represents a mapping between a key and a value. The Map interface is not a sub-type of the Collection interface and hence, it behaves a bit differently from the other collection types. A Map represents a collection which allows mapping of keys and values to form key-value pairs.

A key is an unique element that acts as an identifier for its value. This allows us to store data in pairs, where each pair is called an entry.

The diagram given below represents the hierarchy of Map.
