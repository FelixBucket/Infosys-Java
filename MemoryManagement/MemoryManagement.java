/* 

The memory is logically divided into two primary sections - Stack and Heap.

All local variables and method invocations are stored in the stack

All objects along with their instance variables are stored in the heap


*/



/*

Step 1: The reference variable is created in the stack

Step 2: The object is created in the heap

Step 3: The reference variable in the stack referes to the object in the heap


Notes:

    One reference variable can point to one and only one object at a time

    One object can be referenced by multiple reference variables at any given point of time
