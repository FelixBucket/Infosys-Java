// Data Type

// Primitive - variables of Primitive Data Types hold the value of the data item

// Non-primitive - variables of Non-Primitive Data Types hold the reference of the memory location where the data object is stored. These are also called as Reference Data Types.

// Here are some of the important points about primitive data types:

// Numeric and boolean (true, false) values are written without quotes. E.g. int score = 85; boolean isQualified = true;

// The character value must be written in single quotes while assigning it to a character variable. E.g. char gender = 'M';

// A long value is assigned to the variable, suffixed with L (uppercase letter or lower case letter L can be used). E.g. long salary = 500000L; 

// A float value must be suffixed with F or f while assigning to the variable. E.g. float average = 78.6f;
