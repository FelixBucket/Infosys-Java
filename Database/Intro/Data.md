Before we understand databases, we need to understand the concept of data. Data is a collection of facts about the object of interest. For e.g. data about a student would include information like name, address, roll no, subjects, marks etc. Software Applications need to store data as it is required to answer questions like e.g. how many students have scored above 80? Data is also required to convey a story e.g. how a student is categorized as Top Performer?

Data is raw, just a set of facts which by itself does not convey anything. We need to understand patterns between factual data and give it a meaning. This is called information which helps us with answers to questions like who, when, what, where etc. Synthesis of data and information leads us to answer the how question and take business decisions. This is referred to as Knowledge.
