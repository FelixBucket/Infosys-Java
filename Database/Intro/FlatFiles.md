Data is stored in flat files and can be accessed using any programming language. The file-based approach suffers following problems:

1. Dependency of program on physical structure of data
2. Complex process to retrieve data
3. Loss of data on concurrent access
4. Inability to give access based on record (Security)
5. Data redundancy
