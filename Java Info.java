// Java Syntax MEMORIZE THIS

class Welcome {
    public static void main(String[]args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World! Welcome to Java Programming!");
    }
}

// "main" is the starting point for a Java program. You need this to run the file. It is the same as the "index.html" in a web application

// "void" means there is no return value. It isn't sending anything anywhere. 

// Every method in Java must be enclosed in a class.
